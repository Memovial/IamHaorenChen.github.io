Hi this is Haoren Chen, welcome to my first personal website. I have created five pages for my term project for cs601 in Boston University, and it is been a fun experience. here I am going to walk you guys through.
included files are five html pages, one JavaScript, one css file, and an image folder containing all the images I am using for this project. The first page is simply an introduction about myself. Two parapraphs
describes my background.The second page is gallery. I do not have much personal photo to share.So I pick some of the favorite games and my hometown to fill up the gallery.Third one is my current schedule, I do have a 
parttime job as of right now, so I am between work and study. Last two are two little games I have created.
