            <h3>My Education Background</h3>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Haoren Chen, a native of Guangdong, China. 
                Born and raised in this vibrant province, I've been shaped by its rich culture and dynamic environment.
                My academic journey has been a fascinating one. I pursued an undergraduate degree in economics, 
                delving into the intricacies of market dynamics, resource allocation, and the global economy. 
                However, my curiosity and passion for technology led me to explore a different path. Currently, 
                I'm enrolled in a master's program in software development, where I'm immersing myself in the world of code, 
                algorithms, and software engineering.

            <h3>My Personal Life</h3>
            <p>
                Beyond academics, I find joy in various hobbies that provide a balance to my life. 
                Video gaming has been a long-standing interest of mine, offering an immersive escape 
                into captivating virtual worlds and an opportunity to connect with others in the gaming 
                community. On sunnier days, I relish the freedom of biking, exploring the world around 
                me, and enjoying the beauty of nature.With this diverse background and a keen interest 
                in both economics and technology, I look forward to the exciting opportunities that the 
                future may bring, bridging the gap between these seemingly disparate fields and finding 
                innovative solutions at their intersection.
